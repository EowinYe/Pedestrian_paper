With the development of deep learning, intelligent driving has become a hot topic, and one of the subfields is about pedestrian detection. Object Detection based on Convolution Neural Network has made great breakthrough in recent years, and the application of Convolution Neural Network to real-time pedestrian detection has become a recent trend.

This paper will explore the Fast Pedestrian Detection Based on Convolution Neural Network. This project will be based on the Darknet deep learning framework. It will train and test in KITTI data set. We will reference YOLO and set the evaluation function. Finally, we will compare YOLO and tiny-YOLO perfomance and speed.

The experimental results show that YOLO basically meets the requirements of real-time pedestrian detection, and performs well in the real environment. However, the model still has many problems, such as it performs bad in the poor weather conditions or night conditions. If it detect small clusters or different classes of small object covered by each other, it will perform bad. For the refinement of the model to be further studied in the future.
